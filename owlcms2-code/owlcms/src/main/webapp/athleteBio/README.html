<h1>Instructions for Athlete Biographies</h1>
<p>This document explains how to display athlete biographies automatically for 
the current athlete.</p>
<h2>Install an HTML editing program</h2>
<p>For Windows, we recommend Microsoft Expression Web 4, which is a free 
download (click
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=36179">here</a> 
to get it).&nbsp; The instructions that follow were tested using that program, 
but they all pretty much work the same.</p>
<h2>COPY the athleteBio directory to a safe location, and work there</h2>
<p>Locate the athleteBio directory in your owlcms installation. If you are 
running the Windows install, locate the "Competition Management" folder. There 
will be a shortcut to the <code>athleteBio</code> directory.</p>
<h2>Repeat the following steps for all the athletes</h2>
<p>This will take a while.&nbsp; Don't say we did not warn you that showing 
pictures was a cute but time-consuming idea.</p>
<h2>1- Copy the picture for the athlete</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Get a membership or registration number for the athlete.&nbsp; If you 
	are hosting a national championship and each state or province has a code, 
	then prefix the code.<ul>
		<li>In the athleteBio provided, you will find two files called qc4123.&nbsp; 
		This is me as an example, where I am from Québec (qc) and have 
		membership number 4123.</li>
		<li class="auto-style1"><span class="underlined">You will be entering 
		this membership number on the "Registration" page in the program 
		(leftmost cell on the page) -- This is how the program will locate the 
		athlete's file.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Get a suitably sized picture for the athlete.&nbsp; You need a passport 
	picture shape, or a square.&nbsp; If the file is very large, use a program 
	to resize it to something more sensible.&nbsp; You want 400 pixels wide 
	ideally.</li>
	<li>Rename the picture using the membership number.&nbsp; In my example, I 
	renamed my picture qc4123.jpg</li>
	<li>Add the file to the athleteBio folder.</li>
	<li>PRO TIP: if taking pictures of a lot of athletes, do it "mug shot 
	style", with each athlete holding his or her registration number.&nbsp; Then 
	crop the pictures :-) <span class="underlined"><strong>after</strong></span> 
	renaming the files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2- Create the bio file and link it to the proper picture</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Start your HTML editor, open the file called "sampleAthlete.html"</li>
	<li>Save the file under the membership as entered in the owlcms program: in 
	our example, I saved my file as qc4123.html</li>
	<li>Right-Click on the picture in the file , and select "Picture 
	Properties". Change the file name to the proper membership name (e.g. 
	qc4123.jpg).</li>
	<li>Edit the information as you see fit.&nbsp; Note that you don't need to 
	provide the name on the page the owlcms program will do that, as well as the 
	current weight, etc.</li>
	<li>It is however a good idea to set the "title" of the page to be that of 
	the lifter.&nbsp; To do this, click on the "split" tab at the bottom left of 
	the page, and locate the "&lt;title&gt;" section.&nbsp; Replace "Sample Athlete" 
	with the </li>
</ul>
<h2>Copy back all your files to the official athleteBio directory</h2>
<p>You're all set to go.&nbsp; You can add files as you wish, or even fix files 
during the competition.&nbsp; The files are looked-up anew every time they are 
shown.</p>
