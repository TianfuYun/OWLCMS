Welcome to the OWLCMS Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System.

- Getting Started
	- Windows 7
        You will find three items related to OWLCMS on the desktop: two shortcuts for using the system
        and one folder.  The folder contains a set of additional links to documentation, uninstalling, and so on.
        The shortcuts are also present in the Start menu if you prefer.

        *** First, Start the OWLCMS program that acts as a web site and will monitor the competition.
        This is done with the "Start Competition Management System". You can minimize the black window, but
        if you close it with the X the system will stop. Should this happen by mistake you can restart the
        system and nothing will be lost, but you will need to refresh the browsers for all the connected users.

		*** Second, use the "Use Competition Management System" to open a browser window.  The browser
		will connect to OWLCMS and display the information about the competition.  Use the Menu
		bar at the top and the various buttons to navigate and edit.

        The "About" menu entry shows you what internet address you can use to connect from other computers.
        If you need more than one display on a given computer, use one browser for the first screen,
        and another browser for the second screen. We recommend that you install the Chrome browser or Firefox
        in addition to Internet Explorer. Most users of OWLCMS use Chrome.
