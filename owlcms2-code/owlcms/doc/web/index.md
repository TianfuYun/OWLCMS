The application runs on a laptop or server at the competition site. It is a Web application, meaning that all the displays are shown using a standard Web browser. Wireless laptops or mini PCs (such as [Raspberry Pi](Raspberry Pi.md) are used to drive the various projectors or monitors. Referees can use tablets (Android or iPhone/iPad/iPod), USB keypads, or wireless Bluetooth keypads to enter decisions. The application is built using the [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com) Rich Internet Application framework. 

The application has been used by the [Québec Weightlifting Federation](http://www.fedhaltero.qc.ca) since 2009 to manage the provincial championships it organizes, as well as by the [Canadian Weightlifting Federation](http://www.halterophiliecanada.ca/accueil_en.html) for national championships. Thanks to the Concordia-International Weightlifting Club and the Montreal Regional Weightlifting Association for their support for early releases of the software.
